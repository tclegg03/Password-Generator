## Description
This website was designed to create a random password that is generated based on the users' selected inputs. Inputs that could be added to the password include uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. After picking paramters the password will have the javascript code will then generate a random password and display it in the textbox on the website. Building this website allowed me to work on getting a better understanding of javascript while using functions, arrays, and "if" statements. 

## Usage
To use this website, click on the "generate password" button under the text field area. Next complete the window prompts and alerts that pop up. These pop ups will help give specific parameters to your password.
